Find shelter is a free open source software solution for shelters and the community.

In a city that struggles with affordability and homelessness, it solves the problem of community members being able to find timely and accurate information as to: 
* How many shelters are nearby and how many beds they have available
* What the eligibility requirements are for particular shelters 
* What are the check - in procedures are to secure a bed at a particular shelter
* Whether that community member is homeless and wanting a place to sleep, an emergency response, social worker, or good samaritan wanting to help someone find a place to spend the night.
